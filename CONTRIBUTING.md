# Contributing to RoboDDL

Most contributions to RoboDDL fall into four categories:

- [Data additions and updates](#data-additions-and-updates)
- [Bug fixes](#bug-fixes)
- [Feature requests](#feature-requests)
- [Others](#others)

## Getting started

If you are new to GitHub or local development, this is the easiest way to get RoboDDL running locally.

### 1. Install Git

Install Git so you can clone the repository.

- Download: [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- Check that Git works:

```bash
git --version
```

### 2. Install Node.js and npm

RoboDDL uses Node.js for local development. The official Node.js installer already includes `npm`, so you usually do not need to install `npm` separately.

- Download the LTS version: [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)
- Check that both commands work:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

### 3. Clone the repository

If you plan to contribute from your own GitHub account, fork the repository first, then clone your fork. If you already have direct access, you can clone the main repo directly.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RoboDDL/RoboDDL.git
cd RoboDDL
```

### 4. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 5. Start the local dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Vite will print a local URL such as `http://localhost:5173`. Open it in your browser.

### 6. Before opening a PR

Make sure the project still builds successfully:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Contribution types

### <a id="data-additions-and-updates"></a>Data additions and updates

- Add or update venue metadata in [`src/data/conference`](./src/data/conference) or [`src/data/journal`](./src/data/journal).
- Verify every changed field against an official source.
- If you only need to fix a deadline, source link, rank, or venue metadata, you will usually edit a single YAML file.

### <a id="bug-fixes"></a>Bug fixes

- Use this for broken UI, wrong countdown behavior, parsing issues, layout regressions, or incorrect filtering behavior.
- Include clear reproduction steps, expected behavior, and screenshots if the bug is visual.

### <a id="feature-requests"></a>Feature requests

- Use this for new pages, filters, sorting behavior, data fields, workflow improvements, or larger UX changes.
- Explain the use case and why the feature would help RoboDDL users.

### <a id="others"></a>Others

- Use this for documentation cleanup, refactors, discussion topics, housekeeping, and anything that does not fit the three categories above.

## Quick workflow

1. Identify which contribution type your change belongs to.
2. Update the relevant files.
3. Verify sources or behavior.
4. Run:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

5. If you changed the UI, also check desktop and a narrow mobile viewport.
6. Open a PR or issue with enough context for review.


## What to edit

- Conference data: [`src/data/conference`](./src/data/conference)
- Journal data: [`src/data/journal`](./src/data/journal)
- Venue loader: [`src/data/loadVenueRecords.ts`](./src/data/loadVenueRecords.ts)
- Conference normalization: [`src/data/conferences.ts`](./src/data/conferences.ts)
- Timezone helpers: [`src/utils/dateUtils.ts`](./src/utils/dateUtils.ts)
- Main UI: [`src/App.tsx`](./src/App.tsx)

## Venue data guide

Venue files are parsed by a small custom loader in [`src/data/loadVenueRecords.ts`](./src/data/loadVenueRecords.ts), so keep them intentionally simple:

- Quote all string values with double quotes. Example: `title: "ICRA"`.
- Keep real numbers unquoted. Example: `year: 2027`.
- Use spaces, not tabs.
- Do not add YAML comments beginning with `#`.
- Do not use advanced YAML features such as anchors, inline objects, or complex multiline syntax.
- Keep `venueType: "conference"` files in `src/data/conference` and `venueType: "journal"` files in `src/data/journal`.
- Delete optional lines that do not apply instead of leaving placeholder content behind.

Supported timezones come from [`src/utils/dateUtils.ts`](./src/utils/dateUtils.ts): `AoE`, `PST`, `PDT`, `EST`, `EDT`, `UTC`, `GMT`, and `UTC±HH[:MM]`.

### Conferences

- Use `submissionModel: "deadline"`.
- Keep `knownEditions` up to date.
- Include `paperDeadline`, `timezone`, `conferenceDates`, `location`, and source links for official editions.
- If the next edition is not announced yet, keep the latest official edition and let the site estimate the next cycle.
- `abstractDeadline` is optional.
- Use `cycleYears: 2` only for non-annual venues such as `ECCV`.
- `futureHints` is optional and only meant for future date/location/link context when the next deadline is still estimated.
- The newest official item in `knownEditions` is the fallback reference for future estimation.
- The app assumes conferences are annual unless `cycleYears` says otherwise.
- If `abstractDeadline` exists and is still in the future, the countdown targets it before `paperDeadline`.

Conference notes:

- Required top-level fields: `slug`, `title`, `fullTitle`, `summary`, `venueType`, `category`, `homepage`, `submissionModel`, `knownEditions`.
- `cycleYears`, `ccfRank`, `caaiRank`, `dblp`, `keywords`, `abstractDeadline`, `note`, and `futureHints` are optional.
- `knownEditions` should contain official editions, not guesses.
- Prefer official CFP or official event pages for `deadlineSourceUrl`.
- Use the real local deadline with the correct `timezone`; the app converts it for display.
- Conference categories should stay aligned with existing filters unless you are also updating the UI logic.

### Journals

- Use `submissionModel: "rolling"`.
- Fill `ccfRank`, `caaiRank`, `casPartition`, and `jcrQuartile` when known.
- Use `"N/A"` when a metric is unavailable or the venue is not listed.
- `sourceUrl` should support the rolling-submission claim with an official journal or publisher page.
- `specialIssueLabel` and `specialIssueUrl` are optional, but should be added together when relevant.
